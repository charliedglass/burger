# burger

This burger app uses the `MvC` model to submit burgers to a menu and 'devour' them.  

Using `express` for the routers and `MySQL` for the database functions, this app stores the burgers you submit in a database floats burgers that are devoured to the right-side by changing the value of the `devoured` field to `true`. Users can submit burgers and devour them with the appropriate buttons on the screen.
